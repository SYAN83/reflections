1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

dunno...

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

not always need to push every commit to remote repo.

3. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

can work independently from that commit without being affected by other contributers

4. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

make a new branch, update the file, push the branch to github and use pull request
